## ⚙️ Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

| Challenge                                                           | Solution                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Navigating between server-side and client-side rendering in Next.js | Implemented hybrid rendering strategies using `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` effectively |
| Managing component state in complex UIs                             | Utilized React Context and Zustand for clean and scalable state management                          |
| Integrating backend APIs with dynamic data                          | Leveraged `useEffect` and React Query to fetch and manage remote data reliably                      |
| Styling inconsistencies across breakpoints                          | Adopted a mobile-first approach with TailwindCSS responsive utilities                               |
| Organizing reusable components                                      | Established a component-driven design system for consistency and reuse                              |
| Offline availability and PWA compliance                             | Added service workers and tested with Lighthouse to meet PWA standards                              |

## ✅ Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- 🧠 **Think in components** – Break down UIs into logical, reusable building blocks.
- 🧪 **Test as you build** – Early testing saves hours of debugging later.
- 🎯 **Performance matters** – Lazy load, minimize payloads, and optimize images.
- 🔍 **Stay curious** – Read documentation, explore new tools, and ask "why".
- 🤝 **Collaboration is key** – Peer learning, feedback, and teamwork elevate everyone’s skills.
- 🧰 **Use tools wisely** – Embrace developer tools like Prettier, ESLint, and Git for maintainability.

## 🤝 Collaboration Highlights

### Who I Collaborated With

- **Frontend peers**: Participated in study groups, shared insights on Next.js and React Native usage.
- **Backend learners**: Integrated endpoints developed by backend teams for dynamic data rendering and API interaction.

### Where Collaboration Happened

- 💬 **Discord Channel**: `#ProDevProjectNexus`  
  Used for brainstorming, asking questions, sharing resources, and syncing progress with backend developers.
